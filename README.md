# Multivariate-Linear-Regression-of-Heart-Disease-Attributes-to-Blood-Pressure
We are utilizing at the UCI Statlog (Heart) data set to perform linear regression in order to predict blood pressure using 4 different models, each with a different number of attributes. We then will report which of these models best predict blood pressure by evaluating and comparing model performance and various error metrics such as the MSE, MAE, and RMSE. This dataset has previously been used for classification in order to identify whether the patient has heart disease or not; however, we want to use this dataset in order to predict blood pressure by linear regression.
